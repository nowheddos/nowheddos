<h2>Hi!</h2>
<p>I'm Chloe. This is my website.</p>

<br><h2>About</h2>
<p><!--I am <span id="age">16.00000000</span> years old.-->I enjoy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJB54aQavqs">video editing</a>, writing, and coding.</p>
<p>I've gone by many pseudonyms, most predominantly nowhed.</p>
	<p>I really enjoy Radiohead, Lemon Demon, and The Strokes.</p>
<p>I'm usually very busy with school, so I can't work on projects as much as I'd like.</p>
<p>You may want to know... Why the name "nowhed"? Short answer: I dunno. Long answer: I came up with it in 2019 or so, when I wanted a new Minecraft username. 
I went to one of those <a href="https://www.wordunscrambler.net/word-combiner.aspx">word combiner websites</a>, typed in a bunch of random words (that I do not remember)
and it spat out nowhed. What I wanted in a username was one that was meaningless, genderless, and short. I liked it, so it's been my online alias since then.
It might have been 'nowhere' and 'dead' or 'head.'</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy viewing my page!</p>


<br><h2>Games</h2>
<p>Web development is fun, but it's more fun when you're making games! I've made a couple Javascript games and you can play them below. Thanks github for hosting all of my nonsense.</p>
<p>I like to play a lot of 'incremental' games in my free time so I've been inspired to make my own in the past. To be honest, Sandwich Game is pretty much the only one that I feel confident in saying I completed.</p>

<br><a href="poem.html"><h2>Writing</h2></a>
<p>I'm somewhat of an ameteur  writer, so it would be foolish of me not to put my writing here. Most of this I wrote back when I was 13-14 grade but others are recent.
I hope you will give them a read. Creative writing is really fun... and a bit cathartic.</p>
