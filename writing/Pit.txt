The bore of black bitumen,
A pit in the yard,
I stared in the crevice,
Its walls dark and charred.


"Hello, hello!"
Words into black,
"Hello, hello?"
Nothing came back.


Can you not hear me?
Can I not hear you?
I’ll scream to the void,
That's all I can do. 


"Hello, hello!"
So far from here,
"Hello, hello?"
Would it be clear?


Somewhere from in there,
There has to be a chance,
I expect a call,
From the great expanse


"Hello, hello!"
Is this my fate?
"Hello, hello?"
Always too late.


Naught from the dusk yet,
I still await you,
Is it dangerous,
For you to talk too?


Millenia past by,
My ancient words deep below,
Hey, forever-fallen friend,
"Hello! Hello!"
