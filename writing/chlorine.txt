Revolving door permits my entry
Acronymed athletic area’s class
Wafting chlorine assaults the nose
I find the frosted fractured glass
Refractions create twilight wars

Had we just walked on stone?
The floor’s texture escapes me now
Seems a fever dream of centuries past
But the memories appear somehow
When seventeen arrives on time

Round the corner and see past
The faux ocean’s thirty yards
Temperature controlled environment
Rubber augments strewn far
Chlorine coats my mind

Submerged swimmers reach upward
And say a silent prayer
“I hope the surface tension breaks
And lets me breathe the air”
The bubble effortlessly shatters

Summer aches and fall encroaches
And bring a chilly winter whisper
Yet those lapping the indoors
Say the air doesn’t feel crisper
Their odyssey continues on

Rhythmic floaters take survival
And form an acrobatic art
A human statue gone in a splash
Suspended from the start
They return with the chlorine.
