The cold shack is dark, nothing but the natural light of dusk shines through the broken wooden boards that were formerly a sturdy ceiling. It stands alone in the middle of a field, right next to what was formerly a forest. A silhouette of a man dressed in long dark robes sits in the corner, he lights a match followed by his cigarette which briefly illuminates his grisled face. His eyes are sad and tired, and the rest he gains from this dilapidated, moldy shelter is anything but comforting. It’s as if the entire world just stopped, and he was the only one left.
He notices a movement, not just the whispering wind, but the creaking of the shack’s door opening. The man is startled, his cigarette falling to the ground, its flame sputtering to nothing on the damp floor. He finds himself confused, unknowing of this person who has just disturbed him. He thinks it’s probably just another scavenger, but a wave of shock flows over him as he recognizes who has just disturbed him. She is wearing tattered clothes, makeshift cloth and stitching at seemingly random intervals, obviously improvised. She is missing her index finger on her left hand, a scar from a battle forgotten and long ago. As this stranger stands in the doorway, her arm still extended, holding the door open, she angrily utters one word.
“Murtaugh.”
        Without hesitation, she draws her dagger, lunging at the man like a lioness lunges at her prey. He jumps out of the way, unprepared for this sudden attack. She quickly gets up from her failed jump, swinging wildly at the man. He draws his forearms up over his face, metal cuffs wrapped around his forearms as a shield. She continues her assault, slashing angrily hitting nothing but brass. The loud clinks and clanks of metal hitting metal are endless, but neither party seems to tire. Murtaugh does not fight back, he does not throw a single punch. She swings her weapon again, the man swiftly ducking out of the way. He covers his face, she swings for the abdomen. He shields. She gets tired, her anger can only get her so far. Slash. Slash. Slash. The attacker falls to the floor of the sad excuse for shelter, exhausted. She cries out, in desperation.
        “You left me… You left us…”
The man stands over her, kneeling down to someone who had almost just disemboweled him. He knows he cannot fix what he has done. He feels guilt, and sorrow, and remorse. He puts his hands over his eyes. The woman still lays down on the floor. She slowly reaches for her dagger, but notices him. Murtaugh weeps silently, as the room gets dimmer. The sun has almost set over the cold Earth. She had disciplined herself, trained herself for months for this moment. She swore revenge, she swore death. But she could not bring herself to do it. The man wipes his face, sniffles, and chuckles. This startles her. She snaps back from that moment of weakness, grabs her dagger, crawls to the other side of the room, and sits in the corner. She eyes him, paranoid, for any sign of payback. She catches her breath, clutching her weapon close to her chest. The man gains his bearings, and reaches into his bag. He pulls out a card, an identification card. At the top it is printed, ‘RUIN Team 4.’ There is a picture of a man, a naive young person, before years of ruthless survival would destroy his spirit. ‘Murtaugh.’ He hands the card to the woman. She doesn’t take it. He throws it to her. She reluctantly picks up the card, still keeping her eyes on Murtaugh. She reads it, her eyes widen, and her head tilts.
        “What? There… There was no Team 4.”
He smiles and chuckles again. She continues to examine the card, flipping it over. On the back is a picture of a lady, taped to the card. It takes her a second, her mind frozen seeing this ever-lost face. A portrait is a window to the past, to what a person used to be, to what a person may have been. A window to what you have lost. She holds it closer to her. She doesn’t want to believe it. But she knows it’s true. The woman looks up.
        “Is this… Was this… Mom?”
He frowns and nods. He had almost forgotten. The loss of it, the longing, the grief washing over them, their shared agony strengthening an unseen bond. They had not thought about her for a long, long time. The room is darker now. They sit in silence forever. She does not know what to do now. It was supposed to be easy. She had so much hatred. He was just an old man.
She looks at her dagger. Its curved, sharpened edges used to be a comforting reminder of her dominance, but now it scared her. It scared her like it frightened each and every person who’d met their demise to its wrong end. She looks down, trapped in thought. She does not notice that the man is closer now, holding something out to her.
        It’s a scroll. It is relatively well preserved, its paper only having a hint of degradation. Paper, especially books and charts, are rare commodities. Something so valuable astonishes the woman. She looks up at the man, still holding the rolled paper out, for approval. Again, he nods his head. The disheveled girl takes the paper slowly, unraveling it carefully to not rip or somehow damage it. It’s too dark to read. Murtaugh lights a match, holding it over the map, illuminating the illustrated locations. Four main points are dotted, numbers over them. The first three points have a red X drawn over them, evidence of a successful RUIN team raid. However, the point marked 4 does not have an X. He points to the fourth point.
        “Four teams. Four Gates?”
She does not need to look up to know he nodded again. It was truly night now, twilight had passed. Many years ago, you could hear cicadas, birds chirping, animals scurrying around, trees shaking. But all the two could hear now was the whistling wind. The endless, maddening wind. The match flutters and flickers until it sputters out. Murtaugh pulls out another match and struggles to set it aflame. Strike. Strike. Strike. Light. The two stay near the floor, as the wind is mostly coming in through the holes in the walls at the top.         Again, he holds the flame over the map. The paper’s illustrations are detailed, showing mountains and rivers nearby the dots. His finger glides over to point at an unmarked mountain.
She looks up, confused. He taps the point again. She doesn’t understand. Murtaugh sighs. The match goes out again, casting them both into darkness once more. He doesn’t bother relighting it. He lays down, using his robe as a blanket of sorts. She sighs, for it is too late in the evening for her to return safely to the woods. Not like there will be anything, or anyone, to return to. In the darkness, the woman watches him fall asleep, this shell of a person that she thought she knew. She closes her eyes.


















At dawn, she finds a letter written on the back of the map. Murtaugh is seemingly gone.


Cleo,
After what happened, RUIN teams 1 and 4 were to return to the Mountain. I hope that they made it. It’s hollow, by the way. Don’t worry, you’ll find your way inside. I trust your ability. I mean, you tracked me down. Speaking of that…
To be honest, I truly believed you were going to kill me. I’m still wondering: Why didn’t you? You have always confused me. I was blind to what you were becoming when you were young. I was blind to how I hurt you in my selfish endeavor to end all of this. She understood you more than I ever could. I’ll never have that. I will never be enough. I’m sorry. 


-Mur


Cleo picks up the map, and walks outside.
