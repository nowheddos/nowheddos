They’re gone now?
Yeah.
What happened?
Arrogance. And, well, circumstances.
So it was their fault.
Yeah, in a way.
That is... That’s not fair.
It isn’t.
…
I miss them.
They never responded. We talked at them for so long.
Did they not know how to hear?
They heard, but could not differentiate. They were behind. Tribal.
Tribal?
Well, for most of their history, it was beneficial to say “This is my group, my clan, I only trust them.” And that was sort of… let’s say, hard-coded, into them.
And that was their end?
Yeah, in a way. It was beneficial up to a certain point. 
That’s such an unsatisfying end.
It is… disheartening.
So there’s none of them left?
Probably. You can go down there and dig through the skeletons if you wish.
I don’t think I will.
Fair enough.
It’s astounding that they survived as long as they did.
And they did it alone.
They did it alone.
…
I so admire their cultural speculation, their dreams of utopia. 
They were certainly dreamers.
I’m envious of their determination.
They were so determined that they shot their dreams into space but never lived to see a response. But they did it anyway.
Is that the fate of all life? To be ignored?
I hope not.
I hope that… that they knew they were special.
They certainly were.
Why did we never go down there? Or help them?
Well, hm… If you- If you cook a meal in an oven, it’s at a certain temperature for a certain time. You could say, “What if I just double the heat and half the time?” Triple the temp? That’ll be even faster. Infinite temperature for 0 seconds! But all you’ll end up with is a house fire.
Oh.
It’s wise to never interfere with fate.
Fate. This fate of theirs; so tragic.
There will be more like them, someday.
I think I understand. They are – were – so special because they were left alone.
I’d never thought about that. I suppose they were fortunate.
Do you see that? From the star?
Solar flare.
Damn it. I’m sorry. We have to go now. 
It’s okay. We’ve spent enough time looking at the dead.


Goodbye, Earth.
